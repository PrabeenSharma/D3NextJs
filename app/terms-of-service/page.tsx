				<h2>10) THE MARKETPLACE</h2>
				<ul>
				    <li>When you access and use the Marketplace, we act as an intermediary for Marketplace Users to transact, and are not a party to any agreement to buy, sell or trade the Assets advertised on the Marketplace. When a User purchases an Asset and a
				        <br /> User agrees to provide that Asset, they are entering into an agreement directly with each other. We do not act as an agent for any User.</li>
				    <li>As we are not a party to the transaction, any interaction between you and another User, including any agreement entered into between you and another User, is a matter directly between you and that User only. Other than our obligations set
				        <br /> out in these Terms of Service, and in addition to the disclaimers in Section 15 below, you agree that we:
				        <p></p>
				        <ul>
				            <li>are not liable to you for the accuracy of any Listing, or any failure by a User to comply with these Terms of Service or any other legal obligation;</li>
				            <li>are not liable or responsible for any guarantees or assurances made by the seller of any Listing on the Application;</li>
				            <li>have not made, and do not make any representation, guarantee or warranty that any Asset will meet your requirements or expectations;</li>
				            <li>are not liable or responsible for any increase or decrease in value of any Asset. We have not made, and do not make, any promises (whether explicit, implied or otherwise) as to the value of any Asset, including whether the value of
				                <br /> the Asset will increase or decrease in the future. The Prices of collectible assets are volatile and subjective, and we cannot guarantee that any Assets purchase will retain any value, which may depend on a number of inherently
				                <br /> subjective factors beyond our control, including the desirability of a particular Asset; and</li>
				            <li>will not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of other Users (including where another User has attempted to defraud you, doesn’t have the right to sell an Asset to you, or fails to complete a transaction).</li>
				        </ul>
				    </li>
				    <li>Listing: Where you list an Asset for sale or trade in the Marketplace:
				        <ul>
				            <li>you must only list an Asset that you own in any Listing;</li>
				            <li>your Listing must be accurate, current, complete and include all the relevant information on the Asset. We reserve the right, but are not required, to amend any listing to supplement, remove or correct information;</li>
				            <li>your Listing must not be misleading (which includes ensuring no material information is left out); and</li>
				            <li>you accept that, any sale of the Asset will be final, and that you will not be able to cancel the sale or retain ownership in the Asset. You enter into a legally binding contract to purchase an Asset when you commit to buy an Asset
				                <br /> at the Price, your offer for an Asset is accepted by the seller (whether as a trade for another Asset(s) or for a Price), or if you have the winning bid in an auction.</li>
				        </ul>
				    </li>
				    <li>Auctions:
				        <ul>
				            <li>You must only place a bid on an auction if you intend to buy the Asset at Price. You cannot revoke a bid once it is placed.</li>
				            <li>Where an Asset is sold by auction and you place the winning bid, you will be obliged to complete the purchase of the Asset at the Price and you will not be able to cancel your offer or negotiate a different Price once your bid has
				                <br /> been lodged.</li>
				            <li>You agree not to engage in any shill bidding (i.e. placing, or organizing someone to place, fake bids to manipulate price, desirability or the search position of your listing).</li>
				            <li>Where we reasonably believe that you have engaged in shill bidding, we may suspend, or terminate your Account.</li>
				        </ul>
				    </li>
				    <li>Trading: Where you have entered into a trade with another User, that trade will be final and you will not be able to cancel the trade or negotiate a different trade.</li>
				    <li>Prices specified on the Marketplace are set by the User offering the Asset for sale or trade. Prices are in USD (US Dollar). We do not make any representation that Prices set by Marketplace Users are reasonable or reflect the value of an Asset.</li>
				    <li>D3 facilitates the sale of a name token, which represents an expression of interest in a domain name within a top-level domain (TLD) following the TLD’s successful delegation by ICANN. In the event that D3 is unable to receive delegation to
				        <br /> launch the TLD associated with a name token, the holder of a name tokens at the time of notice may be eligible for a partial or full refund of the original registration fee, subject to certain terms and conditions.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>11) FEES AND PAYMENT</h2>
				<ul>
				    <li>Payments for our Services or Assets (through both the Store and Market) can be made by:
				        <ul>
				            <li>using credit cards approved by us and processed by our third party service providers; or</li>
				            <li>using a cryptocurrency wallet, such as MetaMask.</li>
				        </ul>
				    </li>

				        <p></p>
				        <ul>
				            <li>use the funds to pay for Assets or Services on the Application; or</li>
				            <li>instruct us to transfer the funds to your nominated bank account.</li>
				        </ul>
				    </li>
				    <li>You authorize us to deduct our Fees from funds held on trust and retain any interest earned on the funds held on trust.</li>
				    <li>If we allow you to transfer any kind of cryptocurrency or virtual asset (excluding an Asset) to the Application, these will be held in your App Wallet until such time as the cryptocurrency is transferred out of your App Wallet to an external
				        <br /> wallet.

				        </ul>
				    </li>
				    <li>We reserve the right to apply a fee for our services, and the applicable charges will be clearly presented during the checkout process.</li>
				    <li>Banks and other credit or debit card issuers may offer a dispute process or credit or debit card payments. If your bank or issuer determines that a transaction on the Marketplace should be refunded (a “Chargeback”) and you are the seller,
				        <br /> we will give effect to the Chargeback by debiting your App Wallet. Where we give effect to the Chargeback, you agree to indemnify us against any costs incurred as a result of the Chargeback, and authorize us to debit your App Wallet for
				        <br /> the amount of any such costs. If your App Wallet contains insufficient funds for the Chargeback or our costs and we are unable to debit your App Wallet, this will create a debt between us and you.If D3 believes that fraud or attempted fraud,
				        circumvention of any of these Terms or the Privacy Policy, or any violation of law or regulation is taking place with respect to any payment or transaction, we may take action to withhold,
				        <br /> delay, or cancel the transaction, or seek repayment of payments associated with such fraud or violations, in our sole discretion. In such cases, we may also suspend or terminate a User’s access and use of any Services.</li>
